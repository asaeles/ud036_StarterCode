# Python Movie Trailers Page Generator

This simple Python project is used to generate a static HTML page containing the list of movies hard-coded into the `entertainment_center.py`.

The project comes with a pre-generated HTML list of Disney.Pixar movies.

## Requirements

Python 2 is required to run the file together with some basic knowledge of how to **run** Python scripts.

## Usage

* Edit the file `entertainment_center.py` to include the list of movies you like, you'll need the following data about the movie:
  1. Title
  2. Release Year
  3. Storyline
  4. Poster URL
  5. YouTube Trailer URL

* Then run `entertainment_center.py` file using Python interpreter

## Known Issues

The first time the page loads may take some time to fetch the poster images, this of course differs based on the size of the poster images sizes and your connection speed.

## Contributions

I encourage you all to contribute into this simple project to make better and more usable.
